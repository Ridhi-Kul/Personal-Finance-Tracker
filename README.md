OVERVIEW-
    1. Track and log your transactions
    2. Organize them
    3. Get summaries of income and expenses
    4. View data via graph

(*) BETTER THAN REGULAR USE APPS AS YOU CAN GET SUMMARIES OF DATA FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH AS WELL
    UNLIKE POPULAR APPS THAT ONLY SHOW A SUMMARY OF MONTHLY EXPENDITURE
(*) OPTIMISE BY ADDING A FEATURE TO SEE AVERAGE DAILY EXPENDITURE IN THAT PERIOD

MODULES USED- 
    1. MATPLOTLIB: Useful for plotting and seeing the graph
    2. PANDAS: Categorize and search for data within the CSV file
